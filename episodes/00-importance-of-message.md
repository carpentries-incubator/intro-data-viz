## What is a chart?

A chart is a visual representation of the relationships among data elements. A visual representation allows people to see and quickly comprehend relationships among data elements by processing the information in the brain's visual cortex[^1].

## Purpose of a chart

The purpose of a chart is to communicate. An effective chart clearly communicates a message to the viewer. An ineffective chart confuses the viewer because it contains no message or several muddled messages.

## Components of a chart

The individual pieces that we need to build a chart are:

- Data arranged in a table
- A message about the data
- Graphical elements

An imbalance in any of these components will make a chart ineffective or impossible:

- Without data, a chart has no information to communicate
- Without a message, a chart has nothing clear to say about the data
- Without graphics, a chart cannot visualize information

In this episode, we will talk about data, tables, and messages. We will address graphical elements in the next episode.

### Why no software?

It may seem odd that the key components of a chart do not include software. While software is a useful tool for chart-making, it is not strictly necessary. You can create an effective chart by hand as long as you have the three essential chart components: a table of data, a message about the data, and graphical elements. Software can help you arrive at these three components more quickly, but it cannot automatically create an effective chart on its own. An effective chart communicates, and communication is a human activity.

### Prepare the data

We need to prepare data before attempting to visualize it in a chart. This process is often called "cleaning." A thorough overview of data cleaning is outside the scope of this lesson, but here are some guidelines.

Clean data is summarizable, countable, and calculable. This means that the data table contains no:

- White spaces before or after data in each cell
- Outliers, nulls, missing data, or empty cells
- Formatting, such as color coding, bold, or italicized text

For efficient data analysis and visualization, cleaned data must also be made tidy. Tidy data[^2] means:

- Columns are for variables
- Rows are for observations
- One value per cell

### Resources for learning about cleaning data

- The Data Carpentry Ecology [Data in Spreadsheets](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/) lesson offers step-by-step instructions for managing, cleaning, and tidying tabular data to prepare it for analysis

Learners who have less experience with tabular data may need more specific information than this section provides. If you want to include more teaching about managing and cleaning tabular data, consider pairing this lesson with the Data Carpentry Ecology [Data in Spreadsheets](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/) lesson.

### The role of tables

A table is necessary for making a chart, but is not a substitute for a chart. A table must be read to convey its information. Reading a data table makes it difficult to understand any patterns that might be present in the data. Consider this data table:

| Average Monthly Temperature | Daily Walks per Dog |
|:---:|:---:|
|30 |0 |
|35 |1 |
|45 |1 |
|55 |2 |
|65 |3 |
|78 |2 |
|80 |2 |
|88 |1 |
|70 |3 |
|60 |3 |
|45 |1 |
|35 |0 |

:::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Take 1 minute to read the table and discuss it with your neighbor. How easy or difficult is it to understand the data? What patterns can you detect?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### From table to chart

To create a chart from a table, data elements recorded in different columns of the table are arranged along the `x` and `y` axes of a Cartesian plane.

![x and y axes on a Cartesian plane](fig/XYAxes.png){alt='intersection of horizontal x axis and vertical y axis'}

If we arrange the data points for Average Monthly Temperature along an `x` axis and the data points for Daily Walks per Dog along a `y` axis, we can connect the places where those data points intersect to create this chart:

![a basic chart](fig/dogWalksChart.png){alt='line chart'}

:::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

Take 1 minute to view the chart and discuss it with your neighbor. How easy or difficult is it to understand the data? What patterns can you detect?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Chart message

The relationship between the two elements that emerges when `x` is plotted against `y` creates the message of the chart[^1]. This message is one sentence that describes the relationship that the chart visualizes. This single sentence becomes the title of your chart. If you are having trouble stating the relationship in one sentence, you may have too many relationships for one chart.

It takes practice to identify and articulate a message for a chart, but knowing where it comes from is a first step. You'll practice this skill more during subsequent episodes.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: Identify a chart message

Choose the sentence that best describes the relationship depicted in the chart above:

1. Dogs get fewer daily walks during seasonal temperature extremes.
2. Monthly average temperature varies during the year.
3. Dogs get between 0 and 4 walks daily.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Answer

The correct answer is 1. This sentence describes an interaction between seasonal temperature and number of daily walks. These are the two data elements plotted on the `x` and `y` axes of this chart.

## Importance of Chart Message

Clearly-imparted information - messages - about relationships within a set of data drive problem-solving and decision-making about the entities represented by the data. These solutions and decisions have real-world consequences.

In this lesson we will use a dataset about large North American canids: wolves, coyotes, and foxes[^3]. Public policy and scientific decisions have drastically changed these populations over the past century. The presence or absence of these animals near population centers, livestock, and nature preserves stirs public debate in the present day. You will practice communicating scientific information about large North American canids in messages and charts that the public can understand.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A chart visualizes data relationships in a format that people can see instead of read.
- The purpose of a chart is to communicate.
- Data arranged in a table and a message about the data are two of the three components of a chart.
- A chart's message drives decision-making and problem-solving.
