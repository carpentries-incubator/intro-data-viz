## Introduction

Charts communicate a message about data that is dependent on the type of data.  Data scientists differ on the number of different data types, with some describing as many as 14 unique types.  For this lesson we will keep the number of data types limited to three: discrete, continuous, and categorical.  You can always dig in the finer divisions of these three latter to learn more.

Discrete data are data that can take on a limited range of values but have some quantitative information in those values.  For example, four out of five stars on your favorite restaurant review websites or apps tells you that the ranking was better than three stars but not the best.  The values of the ranking you give to the restaurant could only be 1,2,3,4, or 5, thus quite limited.  Yet, this ranking system still conveys useful information and when your ranking is aggregated with other rankings of fellow users confidence in these rankings increases.  

**  As a general guideline, let's define discrete data as any data that can take a value of no more than 30 unique values but more than 2 values (e.g., 3-32).  Thirty is an arbittary value, but it is based on the precise of the measurements that can be achieved.  In a discrete scale of 30 unique possibilities the maximum precision is 3.3% (1/30). Remember when it come measurement precise, lower is better but not necessarily useful.

As the number unique data values increases beyond 30 the data are characterized as continuous data.  When you measure the length of something with meter stick or ruler you are likely generating continuous data.  That is as long as the group of objects you are measuring range in length by more than 30 of the smallest tick marks on the stick.  Or the objects could in theory range by more.  

On the over extreme of limited unique values are categorical data.  Categorical data do not represent quantitative information but qualitative data (i.e., information that is not a number, but a descriptive property of the system of interest).  Experimental treatments like vaccine vs. placebo in clinical trials or fertilizer vs. no fertilizer effects on crop production are examples of categorical data.  Categorical data can take on many different values and can sometimes contain organization structure that appear to cross over to being discrete.


To discuss these data types and later decide what charts to make and how to make them (Episode 3) we are going use a long-term dataset collected on the canids of North America.  The data are presented in Newsome and Ripple 2015 ![A continental scale trophic cascade from wolves through coyotes to foxes](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12258).  (Give a brief summary of the paper and the data)

## Challenge 1

Choose the answer that most closely reflects your opinion.
Data visualization is for ____.

a) scientists
b) everyone
c) formal reports
d) economists

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
`b) everyone!`

## Challenge 2: Pair the data type names with the examples    

| Data Types  |   Example of data |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. discert   |  a. 1,2,3,...1000 |
| 2. continuous  |  b. 0,1 |
| 3. catagorical  |  c. dog, cat, turtle |

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

1. -> b
2. -> a
3. -> c

## Data Types  


## Four Common Chart Types

Comparison
Composition
Distribution
Relationships

## Identify the message  

What is the message of this graph?  
![Figure ? Pie chart of the abundance of canids are fox or coyote](fig/compositionPlot.png){On average across North America throughout the collection period foxes made up 7?% and Coyotes made up 2?% of the canids}
Discuss message as a group

What is the message of this graph?  
![Figure ? Fox populations before Jan 1, 1970 were greater than after 1970](fig/comparisonPlot.png){North American fox populations averaged 3765 (units) prior to Jan. 1, 1970 and 2062 after}
Discuss message as a group

What is the message of this graph?  
![Figure ? Coyote populations in Maine ranged from zero to 2741 throughout the collections period and had a median of 1393 and mean of 1296 units ](fig/distributionPlot.png){Coyote populations in Maine ranged from zero to 2741 throughout the collections period and had a median of 1393 and mean of 1296 units}
Discuss message as a group

What is the message of this graph?  
![Figure ? Fox populations tended to decrease as Coyote populations increased](fig/relationshipPlot.png){NEED BETTER DESCRIPTION}
Discuss message as a group

## Describe the message  

## Illustrate the message  

In a drawing application of your choice (including pencil and paper), draw a chart that matches the following descriptions.

1. The presence of wolves promoted fox abundance more than coyote abundance in the 1980s.
2. Higher mean annual air temperature decreased the ratio of foxes to coyotes across North America.
3. Overall fox abundance has a log-normal distribution.  
4. The proportion of all canids that are coyote increases from eastern to western locations.


 
## Use a flow chart to choose a chart for your message  




## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![Example figs](https://excalidraw.com/#json=M5p-guinhbiUarNN8Y_fK,GZXhOkPA4qLCIgbEx9i12A)

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![Figure ? Pie chart of the abundance of caninids are fox or coyote](fig/compositionPlot.png){indicate the percentages}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Charts convey messages with interchangeable nouns and verbs
- Chart types ..
- Practice with linking chart types with charts is a valuable skill
